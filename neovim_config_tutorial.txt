init.lua can be thought of as an index.html so when we require("folder") it will search for init.lua and load whatever is in there
if we want to load something selectively we can do require("folder.{lua_file_name}")

package managers are needed to manage the downloading of packages. Im using packer and added a plugin.lua file for that.
